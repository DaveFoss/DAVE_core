    "1. Install Python. A easy way to do that, offers the Miniconda distribution. [Download Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)\n",
    "2. Install Git. [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)\n",
    "3. The GitLab server where DaVe is hosted is [GitLab ZV](https://gitlab.cc-asp.fraunhofer.de/DaVe/DaVe). Every Fraunhofer employee has automaticly a account for the zentral Fraunhofer GitLab.\n",
