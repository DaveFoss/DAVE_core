    "\n",
    "1. Install Python. A easy way to do that, offers the Anaconda distribution. [Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)\n",
    "2. Install Git. [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)\n",
    "3. Create a GitLab account. The GitLab server where DaVe is hosted is [GitLab IEE](https://applik-d07.iee.fraunhofer.de/users/sign_in) (You need to be within the fraunhofer iee network)\n",
